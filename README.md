CalendarReminder
================
Calender/ToDo Application I am currently working on.
First big personal project I'm taking on, still a lot of new stuff.

Expected Result: 
A calender view which shows the upcoming appointments/events for the month.
Ability to create new events quickly.
Switching over to ToDo window shows items which do not necessarily have a due date (might be seperate from calender)
Able to create templates of ToDo items/events to create them easily.

Future ideas:
Email Notifications
Syncing with other devices (Need to create apps on other devices first)
